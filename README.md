# [The Official Bylaws of the Science and Technology Wing](/Bylaws.md)

Kings Court English College House, University of Pennsylvania

*Last Amended October 27th, 2015*

## Making amendments

If you would like to propose an amendment, simply click on the Edit button on
the [Bylaws.md](/Bylaws.md) document, make your changes, fill out a commit
message (a summary of your changes), and click on the "Propose file change"
button.

When writing your commit message, we would prefer that you follow the following
format (note that the header is the first text box, and that the summary is the
second one):

> Header line: briefly explain your amendment in one line

> As necessary, a few lines of text explaining your amendment in more detail,
> possibly giving some background about the underlying issue and why you wish to
> make this amendment. The body of this summary can take up several paragraphs.
> If your amendment is a major change, we encourage you to put a bit of time
> into writing this summary in order to make it easier to carry on a meaningful
> discussion.
>
> Proposed by: Your name &lt;your-stwing-username&gt;  
> On behalf of (optional) : Whoever reported it &lt;member-stwing-username&gt;

(As a side note, do not leave your full STWing email address, as commits and
pull requests publicly accessible and will open your email to spam harvesters.)

If you need help making an amendment, or simply do not want to create a Github
account for the express purpose of making an amendment to the bylaws, you may
ask a member of the Continuum to submit the proposed amendment on your behalf
(in which case, your name will be added as "On behalf of", and the name of said
Continuum memer will be added as "Proposed by").
